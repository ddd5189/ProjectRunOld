# ProjectRun

**By Drew Donovan**

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

## Description

ProjectRun is a 3D Side Scroller Parkour game with an emphasis on satisfying movement. 

The goal is to be the quickest to get from the start to the end, making challenging moves look effortless and making snap decisions with only fractions of a second to think.

How fast can *you* make it to through?


## Project Overview

I, Drew, am developing ProjectRun all on my lonesome. This is not only a project where I'm trying to make a fun game, but it is also a learning experience as I enter the world of Game Design professionally. I attended the Rochester Institute of Technology and will soon graduate with a BoS in Game Design and Development. While I've made many games academically, as well as started on many solo projects, I've struggled with sticking with them. Here I plan to change that. 

My idea started with how I can create and use a swinging mechanic that is as satisfying to use as the one in Insomniacs Spider-Man. A tall order I know, but I'm motivated to see it through.
